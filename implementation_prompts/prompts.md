# AMI Boston One-Pager – Implementation Prompts 7 to 15

## CONTEXT FOR CLAUDE OPUS 4
This file contains detailed implementation instructions for completing the AMI Boston 2026 site. These prompts should be executed in order, focusing on high-priority items first. Cross-reference with:
- `EXECUTION_TODOS.md` for prioritized task list
- `meetings/site-review6.05.md` for specific requirements
- `meetings/initial_site_copy.md` for updated content

## EXECUTION PRIORITY
1. **High Priority (Prompts 7, 8)**: Budget section, Activities section - critical for site completion
2. **Medium Priority (Prompts 9-13)**: Content sections that enhance the site  
3. **Low Priority (Prompts 14-15)**: Visual enhancements, can be deferred

The site is currently functional at localhost:5173. All changes should be made to `src/App.tsx`.

## Prompt 7: Budget Section

1. **Add the Budget section container** at the appropriate place on the page (likely after earlier content sections but before the timeline and footer). Label this section clearly as **“Budget”** using a section heading or a similar component.
2. **Insert the budget content** as provided in the AMI Boston One-Pager copy. This includes the key financial points such as fees, expected headcount, projected income, and major cost allocations. For example, use the line: *“Fees: \$1,295 per attendee · \$150 pre-workshop | Head-count: 60 paid + 10 comp | Income: ≈ \$64,750 | F\&B target: 60–65% | AV & Misc: 15–20% | Room block: 45 rooms × 3 nights @ \$250 | Space rental: typically comped via F\&B”* as the baseline content for this section (split into multiple lines for clarity if needed).
3. **Format the budget details for clarity.** Use a list or series of bullet points to separate each item, ensuring the information is easy to scan. For instance, you could break the example above into bullets: one for fees, one for head-count and income, one for cost targets, etc. Alternatively, if the design calls for a single-line presentation with dividers (as shown by the “·” and “|” in the copy), maintain that style. In either case, emphasize each key term (e.g., **“Fees:”**, **“Head-count:”**, **“Income:”**) in bold, followed by the values, so that the numbers stand out.
4. **Apply any copy edits from the latest guidance.** Double-check all figures and wording against the most recent info. For example, ensure the attendee fee is correct (e.g. \$1,295, not an outdated amount) and that the headcount reflects the latest expected numbers. If the wording has been updated (for instance, using the word “approximately” instead of the symbol “≈” for income, or spelling out “Food & Beverage” instead of “F\&B” in some contexts), make those adjustments. Use consistent terminology (if the transcript or task list preferred “participants” over “attendees,” reflect that here).
5. **Include any necessary disclaimers or notes.** If the copy or stakeholders noted specifics like *“This budget does not include funds for speaker fees,”* include a brief footnote or italicized note to that effect at the end of the section. Keep it concise and visually subordinate to the main points (e.g., smaller font or italic style), so it provides context without distracting from the primary budget figures.
6. **Review the visual styling of this section.** Ensure the Budget section aligns with the overall one-pager design. For example, if other sections have an icon in the heading, consider adding a relevant icon (like a budget or calculator icon) next to “Budget” for consistency. Verify that spacing above and below this section is consistent with other sections. The goal is for the budget info to be easy to read and visually in harmony with the rest of the page, while clearly communicating the financial snapshot of the event.

## Prompt 8: Activities Section

1. **Insert an “Activities” section** to outline what participants will do during the meeting. Use the heading given in the master copy or updated guidance. This might simply be **“Activities”**, or a more descriptive title like **“What to Expect”** or **“A Typical AMI Meeting…”** if that’s what the copy uses. (For example, the Vancouver one-pager used *“A Typical AMI Meeting…”* to introduce this content, so use the Boston-specific phrasing if provided.)
2. **Add an introductory sentence (if provided).** If the copy includes a brief blurb introducing the activities, include it at the top of this section in a normal paragraph. For instance, it might say something like *“AMI gatherings blend immersive experiences with collaborative learning, offering a variety of activities to spark innovation and build community.”* Use whatever specific language the Boston copy or transcript provides to set the context.
3. **List the key meeting activities as bullet points.** Create a bullet list (unordered list) that covers the main components of the event. Based on typical AMI meeting structure and the task list, this likely includes:

   * **Optional Pre-Meeting Workshop** – e.g. *“An afternoon deep-dive workshop before the main event (for those who arrive early), focusing on a special topic or local innovation.”* (Use the exact topic or description from the Boston copy if available.)
   * **Networking Receptions & Hospitality** – e.g. *“An evening Welcome Reception on Day 1 to introduce attendees, plus after-hours Hospitality Suite gatherings for informal networking each night.”* (List specific days or details as given in the schedule copy, like the welcome reception on Wednesday evening, hospitality suite nightly, etc.)
   * **Positive Turbulence Speaker Sessions** – e.g. *“Interactive sessions featuring ‘Positive Turbulence’ speakers, where local or visiting innovators share insights (with Q\&A and group discussion).”* If the term “Positive Turbulence” is being used in Boston, keep it; if updated (per latest guidance) to something like “Keynote Innovators” or another term, use that instead.
   * **Site Visits / Off-site Learning** – e.g. *“Off-site visits to local innovative organizations or labs in the Boston area, providing hands-on learning experiences.”* (Include this if the Boston meeting plans include site visits; if transcripts mention specific locations or the decision to have/not have site visits, reflect that. If no site visits, omit this bullet.)
   * **Small-Group Dinners & Newcomer Fishbowl** – e.g. *“Organized small-group dinners on the second evening to connect with peers, and a ‘Newcomer Fishbowl’ session to welcome first-time attendees and share reflections.”* (Only include bullets for activities that are confirmed. For instance, if the “newcomer fishbowl” is mentioned in copy as part of Day 3’s lunch, list it; if not, adjust accordingly.)
4. **Ensure each bullet is concise and descriptive.** Start each bullet with a **bold title** (the name of the activity) and follow it with a brief explanation. Use parallel structure for readability (e.g., all bullets written as fragments or sentences consistently). Incorporate any **updated language** from the transcripts — for example, if the planning team decided to call the “Optional Pre-Workshop” a “Deep Dive Workshop” instead, or if “Positive Turbulence Speaker” should be phrased as the specific theme of that talk, update those terms. Likewise, confirm things like “hospitality suite” vs. “hospitality gatherings” based on the latest copy so the wording matches what attendees will see.
5. **Align the design with other sections.** Check that the bullet styling (indents, bullet symbols, etc.) matches the one-pager’s style (as set in prompts 1–6). If icons are used instead of standard bullets elsewhere, use similar icons here (for example, a small lightning bolt icon for the “Positive Turbulence” sessions, a fork/knife for dinners, etc., if appropriate). This section should flow logically into the next (likely the Meeting Schedule or Premise section). Make sure there’s a smooth visual transition — for instance, if the next section is the timeline sidebar, the last part of Activities might sit adjacent to it or directly above it. Adjust spacing as needed so that this Activities list is clearly a separate section but naturally connected in content, describing what the schedule then lays out in detail.

## Prompt 9: Premise/Blue Block (Meeting Premise Highlight)

1. **Create a highlighted “Premise” section** using the designated blue background (the “blue block”). This full-width section will showcase the core theme or premise of the Boston meeting in an eye-catching way. In Bolt, add a content block and apply the **blue background style** that matches the one used in previous prompts (Prompts 1–6) for important callout sections.
2. **Insert the key quote or message.** If the full copy includes an inspirational quote or a defining statement for the event, place that prominently in this blue block. For example, the Vancouver one-pager used a quote from Steven Johnson:
   *“It’s through the collision between those different ideas, those different world views and those different perspectives that people become more original thinkers.”*
   – Steven Johnson, Author of *Where Good Ideas Come From*
   For Boston, use the specific quote or tagline given (if one exists). It might be a quote from a thought leader or a tagline like “Innovating Together in Times of Change” — use whatever the Boston materials provide. Format this text in a larger or italic font (or use the blockquote style) to set it apart. Include the attribution (e.g., the speaker’s name and source) in a smaller font or italics, as seen in the example, if a quote is used.
3. **Add the explanatory text about the meeting premise.** Below the quote (or as the main content if no quote is provided), include a brief paragraph that explains the theme or the guiding concept of the meeting. For instance, from the Vancouver page: *“AMI meetings are built around the concept of Positive Turbulence – the idea that by inserting some turbulence into your thinking or organization, you create opportunities for ideas to collide and innovation to thrive.”* The Boston premise text might discuss the specific theme chosen for this gathering (e.g., resilience, inclusion, collaboration, etc., whatever the transcripts/master copy highlight as the focus). Add this narrative in regular font (but still within the blue block). Make sure it’s the updated version: if the transcript harvest showed any tweaks (like adding a line about “embracing sustainable practices and inclusion,” which Vancouver’s did), ensure those elements are present or modified according to Boston’s context.
4. **Maintain clear and readable styling.** With the blue background, the text (both quote and explanation) should likely be in white or a light color for contrast. Check that the font size is legible. The quote can be slightly larger or stylized to draw attention, while the explanatory paragraph can be standard size. Use italics for the quote itself if appropriate and ensure attribution text is distinguishable (for example, preceded by an em dash or styled in italics). Keep the alignment consistent — typically center-aligned for a quote in a highlight section works well, but follow whatever alignment the prior prompts established (if other blockquotes were centered or indented, do the same).
5. **Incorporate any latest guidance on wording.** Verify that the content in this block reflects the **latest language**. For example, if the meeting theme title or description changed after editing (maybe they refined “resilient leadership” to a slightly different phrase), update it here. If a placeholder quote was in the copy but the team decided to use a different one (or none at all), implement those changes. Double-check names or terms (e.g., if referencing Indigenous lands or local context as Vancouver did, perhaps Boston’s might reference the city’s innovation history or similar – include such context if it’s in the copy, or omit if not applicable).
6. **Place this section correctly in the flow.** The Premise/Blue Block should appear in a logical spot – likely right after the hero or introduction, before diving into the detailed activities and schedule. (In the Vancouver example, the “A Typical AMI Meeting…” and concept explanation was placed toward the top.) Ensure that when this section is added, it doesn’t awkwardly split other content. For instance, if the Activities section (Prompt 8) is introductory in nature, the Premise block might come just before it or just after it, depending on narrative flow. Adjust positioning as needed so that the one-pager tells a coherent story: Hero (what/when), then Premise (why/overall concept), then Activities/Schedule (what will happen), and so on.
7. **Verify the result visually and textually.** After adding the blue block content, read through it as if you’re the user. Does the quote and premise make the theme clear and enticing? Is the text easy to read against the background? Also, check on different screen sizes if applicable (the blockquote or formatting should not break on mobile). This section should provide a strong, clear understanding of the meeting’s driving idea in just a few lines.

## Prompt 10: Hero/H1 Block (Top of Page)

1. **Establish the hero section at the very top of the one-pager.** If not already created in earlier steps, insert a full-width **Hero/H1 block** that serves as the banner for the Boston event page. This should be the first thing viewers see, containing the event’s name, date, and location prominently.
2. **Set a compelling background image.** Use an image that represents either the host city (Boston) or the theme of the event. For example, it could be a photo of a notable Boston landmark or skyline, or a thematic image that matches the meeting’s focus (innovation, leadership, etc.). If a specific image was provided or decided upon in the assets, use that. If not, choose a high-quality placeholder and note that it will be replaced later. Ensure the image is high-resolution and positioned so that the key parts of it are not obscured by text (you may use Bolt’s focal point setting or similar to center the important part of the image). If needed, apply a slight dark overlay or blur to the image so that overlaid text is more legible.
3. **Insert the event title as the main heading (H1).** In the hero text area, add the title of the event in a large heading font. This title usually combines the meeting’s theme and possibly a tagline. For example, if the theme is *“Resilient Leadership: Innovating Through Adversity”* (as it was for Vancouver), the Boston event might have its own title like *“\[Descriptive Theme]: \[Subtitle]”*. Use the exact wording from the Boston one-pager copy or the finalized theme from the team – this might be pending finalization, so if necessary use the working title and mark it to revisit. Make sure this H1 text is center-aligned (or aligned per design guidelines) and stands out (likely in white or a very light color on the darkened image).
   *If the copy doesn’t yet have a clever theme title, you can use a placeholder such as “Fall 2025 AMI Gathering” or similar, but it’s best to use the intended thematic wording if at all possible.*
4. **Add the date and location as a subheading.** Right below the main title, place the event dates and the location. Format the dates in a clear, reader-friendly way. For example: **“October 15–17, 2025 – Boston, Massachusetts”**. Use an en dash for a date range and include the full city and state (or country if international) for clarity. If the exact dates are not yet decided, put a tentative timeframe (e.g., “October 2025 – Boston, MA”) and be ready to update it. Make sure this subheading text is in a slightly smaller font than the title but still prominent. It can be bold or regular as long as it’s clearly visible. (Double-check any formatting preferences from earlier prompts, such as whether they used italics or a certain color for date/location in the hero.)
5. **Include a call-to-action button in the hero.** Below the text (or to the side, depending on layout), insert a prominent **CTA button**. The label on the button should match the copy’s instruction – common ones are **“Register Now”**, **“Register Today”**, or **“Save My Seat”**. (From the Vancouver reference, the phrasing “Register Now!” was used along with a “Save a seat for me!” line above; check Boston’s guidance if they prefer one phrasing over another.) Use the updated language from the latest guidance: if the team decided to change the CTA text (for example, from “Save a seat” to “Register Now”), make sure to use the correct version. Link this button to the registration page or form. If the actual link isn’t available yet, use a placeholder URL (and note to update it later). Style the button in a high-contrast color – likely the AMI brand color or a bright accent – so it stands out against the background. Ensure the button is a decent size for visibility and taps/clicks.
6. **Add any supporting tagline or intro (if provided).** Sometimes the hero section might have a short sentence to entice the reader, separate from the title. For example, the site copy had *“Join us April 23-25, 2025, for our next in-person meeting, \[Theme].”* For Boston, if there is a line like “Join us for AMI’s Fall gathering” or any brief context, include that either **above the main H1** or as a lead-in to the date/location line, as appropriate. Use the exact wording from the copy and a style (perhaps italic or a smaller font) that differentiates it slightly from the main title, so it feels like an intro.
7. **Ensure the hero text is accessible and attractive.** Check the contrast between the text and the background image. If any part of the text isn’t popping, consider adjusting: e.g., increase the overlay opacity on the image, or change text color to ensure WCAG compliance. All important info (title, date/location, CTA) should be easily readable at a glance. Also, maintain consistency: if earlier prompts (1–6) set a precedent for how hero text is formatted (like all caps or specific font), follow those.
8. **Incorporate final edits from the team.** Before moving on, verify that you’re using the **final event name and details**. The “latest guidance” might have updates like a refined title or a slight date tweak (for instance, maybe the team decides on “October 14–16” instead of 15–17, etc.). Implement those now to avoid rework. Also confirm the location wording (e.g., sometimes they might list the venue as well, like “Boston, MA – Hosted at \[University/Company Name]” if a particular venue is notable; include that if the copy does).
9. **Preview the hero on different devices/sizes.** The hero is responsive by nature; ensure that on smaller screens the background image still looks good (not pixelated or cut awkwardly) and the text wraps or scales appropriately (avoid any text being too tiny or overflowing). The CTA button should remain visible without excessive scrolling. Once it looks great, the hero section implementation is complete.

## Prompt 11: Hotel Tabs (Accommodations Section)

1. **Create the Accommodations section for hotel information.** Insert a new section titled something like **“Accommodations”** or **“Where to Stay”**, as indicated by the master copy or style guide. (The exact heading might be given in the copy; if not, “Accommodations” or “Hotel & Travel” are common choices.) This section will inform attendees about lodging options for the Boston meeting.
2. **Add a tabbed component to list multiple hotels.** Use Bolt’s Tabs component (if available) to handle multiple hotel options in a compact way. Set up the tabs such that each tab corresponds to one hotel option. For example, **Tab 1** could be the main or recommended hotel (often the conference or host hotel), and **Tab 2** could be an alternate hotel (overflow or a different price point). Label the tabs with either the hotel names (e.g., “Hotel Commonwealth” and “Marriott Long Wharf” — using actual Boston hotel names as placeholders) or with simple identifiers if names are not final (like “Primary Hotel” and “Alternate Hotel”). Using the hotel name is preferable if known.
3. **Populate the first hotel tab with content:**

   * **Hotel Name & Image:** Inside Tab 1’s content area, start with the **hotel name** as a sub-header (bold text). Below that, insert an **image** of the hotel. This could be a photo of the exterior or a nice interior shot. Use an image provided by the team or a placeholder if not available, ensuring it’s clear and properly sized (not too tall; you might want to limit height for consistency).
   * **Hotel Details:** Below the image, list key details in a clear format. You can use a short paragraph or a small bullet list. Include:

     * The **address or vicinity** (especially if near the meeting venue, e.g., “Located in downtown Boston, 5 minutes walk from the meeting venue.”).
     * The **group rate and booking info:** e.g., “AMI Group Rate: \$250/night” and any **booking code** if provided (like “Use code AMI2025 when booking”). If there’s a special reservation link, you can incorporate a button or hyperlink text like “Book at \[Hotel Name]”.
     * The **booking deadline:** e.g., “Book by Sept 15, 2025 to secure this rate.”
     * Any perks or notes from the copy: e.g., “Complimentary breakfast and Wi-Fi included” or “45 rooms reserved for our group” if those were mentioned.
     * If the meeting’s venue is this hotel, note that (“All meeting sessions will take place here”) – or if not, possibly mention distance to the venue.
4. **Populate the second hotel tab (and additional tabs if any) similarly:**

   * Repeat the process for **Tab 2** (Alternate Hotel). Use the second hotel’s name and image, and provide its details:

     * Its location relative to the event (maybe a slightly farther distance or another neighborhood).
     * The negotiated rate or note if it’s a different price or arrangement (for example, sometimes a second hotel might not have a formal group rate but is recommended; if that’s the case, say “Approx. \$200/night currently, no group code – recommended alternative option” or whatever the copy suggests).
     * The booking info and deadline (if applicable).
     * Any special notes (maybe this one has free parking or is a boutique experience – include only if relevant and in the copy).
   * If the transcripts or task list mentioned an update (for instance, if they were initially considering two hotels but then secured only one, or added a third), adjust accordingly. If only one hotel is finalized, you might not use tabs at all; instead, just present one hotel. But since the prompt specifically says “Hotel Tabs,” it implies multiple, so use two or more as the content dictates.
   * Ensure consistency: the formatting and level of detail in each tab should be the same so users can easily compare.
5. **Incorporate latest info and edits for accuracy.** Cross-check the hotel names, rates, and codes against the latest provided copy. If, for example, the transcript notes corrected a hotel name spelling or an updated rate, use the correct data. (E.g., maybe the initial copy had “45 rooms at \$250” but the final agreement was 50 rooms at \$240 – use the final numbers from the “latest guidance” if available.) Also confirm the booking deadlines; those can change and are important to get right.
6. **Consider adding a brief intro or note for this section.** If the one-pager copy includes a sentence like “We’ve partnered with the following hotels for your stay:” or any instructions (like “Please book your accommodation separately using the links below”), include that as a normal text paragraph above the tabs. Keep it concise. For example: *“Hotel accommodations: Below are the recommended hotels with special rates for AMI attendees. Choose either option and book by the noted deadline to secure the group rate.”*
7. **Test the tabs and layout.** In the preview mode, click through each hotel tab to ensure content switches correctly and nothing overlaps. Verify that images scale well and text isn’t cut off. On mobile, tabs should stack or turn into an accordion – make sure that is working and each hotel’s info can be viewed easily by scrolling. The first tab (primary hotel) should be active by default on page load, showing its info.
8. **Maintain visual consistency with the one-pager style.** Match fonts and heading styles as used elsewhere. For example, if section headings are usually centered and blue, make “Accommodations” heading that style. If the rest of the one-pager avoids too many sub-bullets, keep the hotel info in a simple format (maybe a short paragraph rather than many bullets). Use italic or icons sparingly to highlight things like the booking deadline or link (e.g., maybe a calendar icon next to the deadline date, or a link icon next to the booking link). However, only use such embellishments if they align with the design system established so far.
9. **Finalize spacing and transitions.** Ensure there is enough spacing above and below this section so it doesn’t clash with adjacent sections (like Speaker Highlights above or the footer timeline below). Typically, there should be a bit of padding to clearly separate it. This “Hotel Tabs” section is largely logistical info, so it likely comes toward the end of the page (after the content that “sells” the event). Double-check the order: it should appear wherever it was intended in the outline (the task list might indicate whether hotels are shown before or after speaker info; generally, logistics like hotels could come near the end). Once placed and styled, the accommodations section is complete.

## Prompt 12: Speaker Highlights

1. **Add the “Speaker Highlights” section to showcase key speakers.** Insert a section heading such as **“Speaker Highlights”** or **“Featured Speakers”**, as per the copy. This section will draw attention to some of the notable speakers or presenters at the Boston meeting. Position this section in the order indicated by the one-pager outline (likely after the schedule/activities and before logistics like hotels, since it’s part of the event content highlights).
2. **Choose a layout for displaying speakers.** Use a multi-column layout or card component that can present multiple speakers side by side. For example, a three-column grid works well if highlighting three speakers. If more than three, you can do two rows (ensure even distribution, e.g., 2x2 grid for four speakers, or a slider if many). The Bolt system may have a “card” or “profile card” component; if so, use it for consistent styling (image on top, text below).
3. **Insert each speaker’s photo and info:**

   * **Photo:** For each speaker, upload or select their headshot image. Use the highest quality images provided, and crop them to a uniform size and shape. (Square or circle crops are common for headshots. If previous prompts or the site style use circular portraits, apply that here for consistency.) Ensure all speaker images are equal in dimensions so the layout looks even.
   * **Name & Title:** Under each image, add the speaker’s **name** in bold and their **title/affiliation** in regular text. Use the exact copy given (e.g., “John Bucher – Executive Director, Joseph Campbell Foundation”). If the copy only provided name and organization, include that; if it also included a shorter title, include as well. Maintain a consistent format for all (e.g., Name on one line, Title and Organization on the next line).
   * **Talk Topic or Tagline (optional):** If the one-pager copy includes the title of each speaker’s talk or a one-sentence summary of their topic, place that either above or below the name/title. For example, *“Telling a Better Story: The Innovator’s Journey”* could go above John Bucher’s name as an italicized subtitle. Keep it brief – one line, two at most – and styled slightly differently (italics or quotation marks) to distinguish it from the name/title. Only do this if such info is provided; if not, the name and title suffice for a highlight.
4. **Repeat for all featured speakers.** Continue adding cards or columns for each speaker highlighted in the copy. Typically, 3-5 speakers might be featured. Use the **updated list of speakers** from the latest guidance: if the transcript indicates a new speaker was added or someone changed, reflect that. For instance, if originally Speaker A was listed but got replaced by Speaker B, ensure Speaker B is in the lineup. Also verify spellings and titles with the latest info – these can change (e.g., promotion or role change). It’s crucial to use the final confirmed data for each person.
5. **Keep the design of each speaker card consistent.** Align text similarly for each card (usually center-align under photos looks neat). If you’re not using a predefined card component, manually make sure each photo and text block is uniform: same image dimensions, same font sizes for names and titles, same spacing between photo and text. Consistency gives a professional look.
6. **Add a call-to-action or reference if applicable.** If the design calls for it and if relevant, you might include something like **“Read Bio”** or **“Learn more”** as a small link or button on each card that could link to a full bio page or popup. However, since this is a one-pager, it might not have separate bio pages; only include such links if the infrastructure is there (the AMI site might not have individual speaker pages, so likely skip unless directed otherwise). If skipping, make sure the content on the card itself suffices as a teaser.
7. **Incorporate any special notes from the copy.** For example, if one speaker is an **AMI member or host**, and the copy flags that (like “Our host, Jane Doe, CEO of XYZ”), you might subtly highlight that in their title or with a small label. Or if a speaker is *“Positive Turbulence Speaker”*, that might already be clear from context. Use your judgment based on the copy – the goal is to reflect what was written. If transcripts mention adjusting language (maybe avoiding acronyms or adding an honorific like “Dr.” to someone’s name), include those changes.
8. **Review the speaker section visually.** Check that on desktop, the speakers align nicely (with even gutter space between them). On mobile, the cards might stack vertically – ensure that looks good (each should take full width when stacked). Verify that no text is cut off and that names/titles don’t overflow awkwardly (you might need to manually break a line if a title is very long, for instance). Also, confirm that this section doesn’t inadvertently clash with surrounding sections: there should be adequate padding above (from whatever precedes, e.g., timeline or premise) and below (before the next section, e.g., chips or hotels). Once it looks polished, the Speaker Highlights section is done.

## Prompt 13: Access & Confidence Chips (Key Benefits)

1. **Introduce the “Access & Confidence” highlight section.** This section underlines the core benefits or values participants gain from AMI, using a visual chip/tag format. It typically doesn’t need a long heading; the chips themselves will convey the message. However, you can include a short lead-in text if the copy provides context (e.g., “By participating, you gain…” or *“AMI offers members:”*). Place this section where it fits logically — likely near the end of the one-pager as a takeaway message (perhaps just before the footer timeline).
2. **Add chip elements for each key benefit.** Use Bolt’s **Chip component** (or a styled text container that looks like a capsule/pill) to create individual chips. According to the task, the two primary chips are **“Access”** and **“Confidence.”** These likely correspond to “access to resources/people” and “confidence to innovate/lead” as themes. If the master copy indicates additional keywords, include those as well (common ones might be **“Community”**, **“Inspiration”**, **“Knowledge”**, etc., but only add what the copy or team has emphasized).

   * Create one chip for **Access**. Simply use the word “Access” (unless the guidance says to be more specific, like “Access to a Network” – but usually a single powerful word on a chip is effective).
   * Create another chip for **Confidence** (again, just the word itself, unless directed otherwise).
   * If adding more chips (say “Community” or “Collaboration”), follow the same single-word format.
3. **Style the chips consistently.** Typically, chips have a background color (perhaps an AMI brand color or a light gray/blue) with contrasting text. Ensure the font style and size are consistent for all chips. Use Title Case or ALL CAPS based on design guidelines or previous prompts’ usage. (If not specified, Title Case like “Access” and “Confidence” is safe.) Make sure the chips are large enough to read easily, but not as large as buttons; they are usually smaller, label-like elements.

   * Choose appropriate colors: for example, if AMI’s palette includes a blue or orange, you might make the chips in those colors. The text on each chip should be high-contrast (e.g., white text on a colored chip).
   * If Bolt allows adding an icon inside the chip and the copy hints at it, you can consider it (like a key icon for access, a shield or upward arrow for confidence). This was not explicitly stated, so include icons only if it doesn’t clutter and if the design system supports it – it’s optional.
4. **Arrange the chips in an appealing layout.** Instead of just a single line, consider the best way to display them:

   * If only two chips (Access and Confidence), placing them side by side in the center of the section would work. Add some horizontal space between them (maybe via margin or a spacer).
   * If four chips, you might do two per line in a centered grid.
   * Ensure the chips are evenly spaced and aligned. You can group them in a container and center that container. The layout should look balanced. (Test how it wraps on mobile; chips might stack which is fine, as long as each chip still has padding around it.)
5. **Use exact phrasing from the copy.** Double-check if the internal language for these benefits was updated. For example, perhaps the transcript noted “we should highlight **Access** and **Confidence** as what people leave with.” Make sure the chips use those exact words. If there was discussion of phrasing (like whether to say “Confidence to innovate” vs just “Confidence”), they likely settled on the single words for brevity – stick to that unless told otherwise. The simplicity of one-word chips is likely intentional for quick impact.
6. **Provide a brief explanatory note (optional).** If the team felt just the words might be unclear to new readers, they might have added a tiny sub-text or a tooltip in design. Typically on a one-pager, though, they will trust the context. If the copy explicitly has a follow-up line like “Access to a vibrant network and confidence to drive change are two key outcomes,” you might include that as a normal sentence below the chips. Otherwise, you can omit additional text to keep it punchy.
7. **Check visual harmony with surrounding elements.** The chips section is a stylistic element, so ensure it matches the tone. For example, if other highlight elements (like maybe there were “chips” or badges earlier in prompts 1–6, perhaps for something like values) used a certain style or color, be consistent. The chips should not clash; they should feel like part of the design system. Also ensure this section’s spacing is sufficient – a bit of breathing room around the chips will draw the eye to them.
8. **Verify with the latest guidance.** Ensure no additional chip was requested in the latest meeting notes. If, say, someone suggested adding “Insight” as a third benefit, include it if it was approved. Conversely, if initially there were more but they trimmed down to two (Access and Confidence), stick to those two. The wording “Access” and “Confidence” should reflect exactly how they want to brand these benefits (capitalization, singular form, etc. – which is likely singular and capitalized as written).
9. **Test on different devices.** On a smaller screen, two chips might naturally line-break into two rows. That’s fine, but see that it still looks balanced (maybe center them on each row). The chips should remain readable and not overlap or shrink too small. Once it looks good and conveys the message that *AMI gives you Access and Confidence*, you can consider this section done.

## Prompt 14: Timeline Sidebar (Meeting Schedule)

1. **Prepare the layout for a sidebar timeline.** The meeting schedule will be presented as a timeline, ideally in a sidebar format next to other content. If the page template or Bolt allows a two-column layout, enable it: one column for the main content (e.g., speaker highlights or narrative) and a narrower column for the timeline of events. If a pre-built sidebar exists, use that; if not, manually create a two-column row (for example, a 8/4 or 9/3 grid for content/timeline).
2. **Insert the “Meeting Schedule” timeline.** In the sidebar column, add a heading for the schedule, like **“Meeting Schedule”**, or simply rely on day labels if a heading was already given in a prior section. Use a vertical timeline component if available; otherwise, a series of stacked text blocks or list items can simulate a timeline. The format should clearly differentiate days and the events under each day.
3. **List each day and its key events:**

   * **Day/Date Headers:** Start with the first day of the event. For example, if the event starts on Wednesday, list **“Wednesday, October 15, 2025”** as a sub-header or bold line. (Use the actual dates for Boston from the final plan; if not confirmed, a placeholder like “Wednesday – Day 1” can be used, but ideally dates are known from the copy or planning.) Do the same for **Thursday, October 16, 2025**, and **Friday, October 17, 2025** (assuming a three-day format as typical).
   * **Events under each day:** Under each day header, list the scheduled items in chronological order. Indent or use bullet points to delineate them under the day. For example:

     * *Afternoon – Optional Pre-Workshop.* (For Wednesday, if an afternoon pre-workshop is planned. If the copy specifies a topic or location for the pre-workshop, include that briefly, e.g., “Optional Pre-Workshop (Deep dive into local innovation project)”)
     * *Evening – Welcome Reception & Introductions.* (Likely Wednesday evening. If a specific venue or host is mentioned, you can add, e.g., “Welcome Reception at \[location]”.)
     * *After Hours – Hospitality Suite.* (If Wednesday night includes a hospitality suite gathering, list it. Use the exact wording from the copy; Vancouver’s schedule used “After hours – Hospitality Suite”.)
     * For Thursday: Start with *Breakfast* (if on the schedule), then *Morning Session – \[Speaker or Activity]*. For instance: “Morning – Positive Turbulence Speaker (Name or TBD), plus BBWI Learning Exchange” (BBWI might stand for something – use the updated Boston terms if different).
     * *Lunch* (if listed as a break).
     * *Afternoon – \[Another Speaker or Activity]*. For example: “Afternoon – Positive Turbulence Speaker (Name/TBD), BBWI Learning Exchange” (if the second speaker session is in the afternoon). Or if site visits occur, it might be “Afternoon – Off-site visits (various locations)”.
     * *Evening – Small Group Dinners.* (if Thursday has organized dinners, list it).
     * *After Hours – Hospitality Suite.* (for Thursday night, if repeated).
     * For Friday: *Breakfast* (if any).
     * *Morning – \[Speaker/Session]*, e.g., “Morning – Positive Turbulence Speaker (Name/TBD), BBWI Learning Exchange.”
     * *Late Morning/Early Afternoon – Newcomer Fishbowl & Lunch.* (Vancouver had “Newcomer Fishbowl & Lunch” as the closing activity on the last day; if Boston does something similar, include it. If they changed it to a different closing session, use that.)
     * *Adjournment* (if the schedule ends at a certain time, you can note e.g., “1:00 PM – Meeting concludes” if the copy mentions it, otherwise it might be implied by the last listed activity).
4. **Use clear formatting for timeline entries.** Distinguish the **day headers** visually (could be bold, slightly larger, or even a different color). Then ensure each event line starts with a time-of-day or general timeframe (Morning/Afternoon/Evening) in bold, followed by an en dash and the event description. The consistent format might look like:
   **Thursday, Oct 16, 2025**
   **Morning –** Positive Turbulence Speaker (Jane Doe) and Interactive Exercise
   **Lunch –** (on your own or provided, as noted)
   **Afternoon –** Site Visit to Local Lab (transport provided)
   ...and so on.
   If using a timeline component, it might enforce a certain structure (like date on one side, description on the other with a line or dot connecting). If so, fill the fields accordingly: date or time slot as one part, description as the other. The key is that each scheduled item is easily associated with its day and time.
5. **Integrate any changes from the latest schedule.** Check the transcript or task list for updates such as:

   * A session being added, removed, or renamed.
   * A specific speaker being confirmed (replace “TBD” with the name if known now, or if they decided to leave the speaker names off the schedule, follow that decision).
   * Timing adjustments (maybe they decided to start Thursday earlier or later – reflect any such tweak).
     For example, if the original plan had two speaker sessions on Thursday but later they combined into one longer session, update the timeline to show one item instead of two. Accuracy is key as this is the final schedule snapshot.
6. **Make sure the timeline fits nicely in the sidebar.** Because sidebars have limited width, watch out for line-wrapping. Long descriptions might need to be abbreviated or split into two lines. It’s okay if an event description wraps to a second line; just ensure the indenting still makes it clear it’s under the correct day. If your timeline component automatically handles this with, say, bullets or connectors, even better. Test the layout by resizing the window: the sidebar might move under the main content on a narrow screen (which is fine). If it does, the timeline will appear above or below other sections; verify that it still reads logically in that order if stacked.
7. **Emphasize important or unique events.** If any event in the schedule is particularly special (like a keynote or a field trip), you might use an italic or a different text weight for its description to draw attention, but use this sparingly. The consistent format is usually preferred for clarity. Another subtle method is to use icons: for instance, a small microphone icon next to “Speaker”, a fork/knife next to “Dinner”, etc., if that was done in earlier materials. Only add these if it remains uncluttered and was hinted at in design guidance.
8. **Double-check clarity and consistency.** Read through the schedule you’ve input and ensure it matches the master copy word-for-word where applicable. Any deviations should only be because of known updates or to abbreviate very long text. Confirm day names and dates are correct (e.g., that the dates align with the days of week – Oct 15, 2025 is indeed a Wednesday, etc.). Consistency check: are all “Morning/Afternoon/Evening” labels used the same way (capitalization, use of en dash)? Are we using “&” vs “and” uniformly (match the copy style)? Such details make the final product polished.
9. **Finalize the sidebar’s placement.** Ideally, the sidebar timeline should start near the top of its corresponding main content section and end by the bottom of it. For instance, if it’s placed alongside the Speaker Highlights, it might start near where the speakers section starts and conclude by the time we reach the hotel section. If the timeline is much longer than the adjacent content, consider options: either let it extend and have white space under the shorter column, or if possible, break out of the sidebar for the overflow (though that’s complex – usually better to let it extend or adjust content). If one column ends significantly before the other, it’s not a big problem on a webpage, but just visually check that it’s not awkward.
10. **Save and verify in preview.** Ensure that the timeline is properly saved and appears as expected. Scroll through it as a user would, and make sure each day’s schedule is easily understood. This timeline sidebar will serve as a quick reference for the event agenda, so accuracy and legibility are paramount. Once satisfied, proceed to the final prompt.

## Prompt 15: Footer – Media Cadence Timeline

1. **Add a footer section for the media cadence timeline.** This section will outline the communication and marketing schedule (cadence) leading up to the event. It will likely be at the very bottom of the one-pager, after all content about the event itself. Start by creating a distinct footer area or section. If the one-pager has a standard footer (with contact info or logos), you can integrate this just above or within it, but visually separated from the main event info sections.
2. **Provide a heading or context if needed.** You can title this section **“Media & Communications Timeline”** or **“Promotion Cadence”** for clarity, unless the design prefers it without a title. A brief introductory line can be included to explain what this timeline is (e.g., “Key communication milestones leading up to the event:”), but keep it concise.
3. **Lay out the timeline of outreach milestones.** List each major media or communication event in chronological order. Use either a **horizontal timeline** component (if only a few points and space allows) or a **vertical list** if that’s easier. Each item should include a date (or timeframe) and a short description. Based on typical event planning, the entries might include:

   * **Save-the-Date Announced** – e.g. *“Save-the-date email sent to members – July 10, 2024.”* (If the Boston meeting was introduced at a prior gathering or via email, use that date. The transcripts might indicate when they aim to do this; if it was said “ASAP” or at Vancouver’s closing session, you might put “April 25, 2025 at Vancouver meeting” or similar. Use exact phrasing from copy if provided, such as “Save the Date announced at AMI Vancouver meeting (Apr 2025)”.)
   * **Registration Opens** – e.g. *“Registration website live – January 2025.”* (Use the precise date or month from the plan. Maybe they plan to open registration 3 months prior; if transcripts say “we’ll open reg in July”, list that month and year.)
   * **Speaker Announcement(s)** – e.g. *“Key speakers announced – August 2025.”* (If there are multiple waves of announcements, you could list each if important: “First keynote announced – August”, “Full agenda published – September 2025”, etc. Tailor this to however the marketing is staged. The master task list might have these items.)
   * **Regular Updates** – e.g. *“Monthly countdown newsletters – Aug, Sep, Oct 2025.”* (If they intend to send regular communications, you can group them or mention frequency. For instance, the task list might note “monthly email updates” or social media posts; represent that in a concise way.)
   * **Final Reminder** – e.g. *“Final reminder to registrants – early October 2025.”* (Or “Reminder email one week before event – Oct 8, 2025” if a date is known.)
   * **Event Takes Place** – *“AMI Boston Meeting – Oct 15–17, 2025.”* (It might be nice to anchor the timeline with the event itself at the end.)
   * **Post-Event Follow-up** (optional) – e.g. *“Post-event survey & resources emailed – Nov 2025.”* (If the plan includes sending materials or surveys after, include that for completeness.)
4. **Use consistent formatting for each timeline item.** For example, if vertical:

   * **Date/Timeframe** – Description.
     Make the date bold for quick scanning, followed by an en dash and the description of the milestone. If horizontal, each point might be a dot with a label; in that case, keep labels short (e.g., “Save-the-Date (Jul ’24)”, “Reg Opens (Jan ’25)”, etc., with perhaps hover or subtext for details if supported).
     Ensure that the tense and perspective are consistent (preferably use past tense for things that will have been done by that point, or simple statements like “announced”, “opens”, etc., all in either future or present for consistency since some are upcoming, some done).
5. **Incorporate updates from the latest communications plan.** The transcript harvest or task list may have specific dates or sequences for these. For example, if they decided the save-the-date would actually go out earlier than initially thought, use the updated date. Or if they added another newsletter or decided to do social media posts on certain dates, include those if appropriate. Make sure no key touchpoint is omitted: the idea is to reassure that there is a plan to promote the event steadily. If certain dates are not pinned down but rather ranges, it’s okay to use the month or “Late Summer 2025” type phrasing as the copy does.
6. **Mind the level of detail:** Since this is a one-pager, we likely want high-level milestones, not every single social media post. So focus on major items (emails, announcements, launches). If the team provided a specific cadence list, use that directly. If not, stick to the logical set we’ve outlined. Generally, 5-7 points is a good number for such a timeline.
7. **Design the timeline for clarity in the footer.** If using a horizontal timeline, ensure labels aren’t too crowded. It may work better as vertical due to potentially longer text. If vertical (list style), you can use bullet points or a simple list with dates. You might also stylistically differentiate this section (like a slightly smaller font or a different background like a light gray) since it’s meta information about the event. However, keep it consistent with the overall style; perhaps it can just reside in the footer area with normal styling.

   * You could also incorporate small icons here: e.g., a calendar icon for save-the-date, a web icon for registration live, a megaphone for announcements, etc., as visual markers for each entry. This is optional; do it only if it enhances readability and matches the design motif used elsewhere.
8. **Label internal vs external communications if necessary.** If this one-pager is intended for internal planning or host use, it might be clear that this timeline is for the planning committee. But if there’s any chance an attendee sees this, you might want to phrase things a bit generally (“announced to members” etc.). Based on context, likely this is for internal use (since attendees wouldn’t usually see the promotion schedule). The copy might implicitly handle this by tone. Just ensure it reads smoothly to whoever the audience is.
9. **Finalize and proofread the entire one-pager content.** Now that all sections (Prompts 7–15) are in place, do a thorough review:

   * Check that section headings (Budget, Activities, etc.) all use parallel formatting (size, color).
   * Verify cross-references: for instance, the schedule timeline (Prompt 14) and the budget section (Prompt 7) both mention a number of days or participants – ensure consistency (if budget says 60 paid attendees, schedule should accommodate that number in activities like newcomer fishbowl count, etc., if mentioned).
   * Ensure no placeholder text remains. Replace any “TBD” or filler text with real info if it’s known or clearly mark it to be updated if awaiting info.
   * Spelling and grammar: fix any typos, especially in names of speakers, hotels, etc. (They must match exactly the official names).
   * Consistency: e.g., if “pre-workshop” is hyphenated in one place, don’t call it “pre workshop” elsewhere; align with the copy’s choice.
   * **Design coherence:** scroll through as a user would. Each section (7 through 15) should feel like part of one cohesive page, not disparate pieces. Adjust minor spacing or ordering issues discovered in this holistic check.
10. **Save and communicate any outstanding needs.** After implementation, if there are any sections that require final content (like awaiting final hotel link or exact dates for media timeline), make a note of those in comments (if the builder allows) or communicate back to the team so they can provide them. The prompts you’ve followed have now built out the Boston One-Pager fully. You can now share a preview with stakeholders for feedback, knowing it’s based on the structured guidance and latest available information.
